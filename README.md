So Hello Every one Hope You Are Doing Good In your Coding Jourmey :)
My Self Ashu Patel 
After Long time I decided to Remake One the most played Game in our Child Hood Which I bet all of you Had Played 
"Stone , Paper & Sccisor "
Which Ussually requires 2 players . but sometime we a re all alone and want to play that game :(
Same Thing Happen to me last night But It dint bother me for long time cause i have a Weapon with me thats a Coding ,
Guys If you are litterally into coding you can code anything in this world:
So , I decided to design the code  for this game :
In this file i have decided to Explain what things i have revised and try to explain you guys which help you to understand different concepts of java used.
So before designing any thing make a imagenary image of that thing in your mind and design a flow chart of that and then code according to that .
firstly initialize all the required variables then print the specific instrcution to the users which tells them how to use the game because they dont know what to [press ] . 
later take use of if - else ladder for solving the conditions . most important is that you  should use random tool of java for generating random choices of computer . because you are all alone and you decided to play 
with your computer . 
after that make use of while loop wisely to iterate loops for number of times you want to play with your computer . 
dont forget to include counting variables and increament them as per your conditions which will help you calculating the final result and after the loop completes it will tell the final winner of the game.
This program covers all the basic fundamentals and concepts of java. Which we learned in our high schools :)
